## splitverse

### the what

a web app dedicated to the concept

**_pay 💰 for what you 🫵🏼 eat_** [ "🍕", "🍔", "🌮", "🍺", "☕️", " " ]

built with the idea of learning and an attempt at cementing the understanding of react, and some of it's concepts

### the why

ever been in a position where you've felt like you've paid for more than what you ate at a group meal 🤔...or maybe feel like you paid less? 🫣

you don't have to relate to that anymore 🤩

splitverse is exactly the tool you need to tackle this unusual conundrum

recreate your bill with the ability to add members for the split on each item

ensuring people end up paying only for things on the bill that they had,
rather than an even split on the overall bill

### **_current_** caveat

splitverse(v1) does not yet allow total fine-grain control over the member splits on food items

i.e., the members on the item are still equally charged.
future iterations promise to bring this fine-grain control by splitting the amount on each item through consumption percentages so that not all consumers are equally charged
